                    Riomaggiore is a historic coastal village in Liguria, Italy, and the easternmost of the five villages of the Cinque Terre. Founded in the 8th century, it is known for its colorful houses built vertically into steep cliffs, its small harbor, and its deep connection to the Ligurian Sea. Riomaggiore is part of the Cinque Terre National Park and is protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
                
                    The village is best explored on foot and is easily accessible by train. There is no sandy beach; swimming takes place from rocks and the harbor, where the sea is often clear and inviting. Riomaggiore is especially appreciated for its sunsets, coastal walks, local cuisine, and relaxed rhythm of life.
