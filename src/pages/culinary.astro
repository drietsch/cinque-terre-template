        description: "Rio Bistrot is less about the view—though it is spectacular—and more about the restraint of the kitchen. They take the staples of the coast (anchovies, sea bass, local herbs) and treat them with a lightness that feels contemporary but deeply rooted. The tasting menu is a dialogue between the sea and the terraces.",
        giuliaComment: "I come here when I want to remember that our simple food can also be elegant. I always notice how they use the lemons—not just as a garnish, but as a structural element of the dish. It's best for a long, quiet dinner as the harbor lights come on.",

                            To eat in Riomaggiore is to understand scarcity. For centuries, this village had no flat land for cattle, no wide fields for grain. It had only the verticality of the cliffs and the depth of the sea.
                        </p>

                                    The story begins in the <strong>terraces</strong>. Every inch of soil was earned, carved out of the rock to plant grapevines and olive trees. This is why wine here is not just a drink; it is the village's primary currency of labor. The Sciacchetrà you sip today is the same liquid gold that has sustained these families through generations of isolation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Then there is the <strong>sea</strong>. Because the village was poor and the work was hard, the food became simple. Fish is served with little more than a squeeze of lemon and a drizzle of the oil pressed from those hillside groves. There is no need for heavy sauces when the catch was in the water three hours ago.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                    You will notice that <strong>menus are short</strong>. This is not a lack of choice, but a commitment to the day. If the sea was rough, there is no sea bass. If the 'orto' (the garden) is between seasons, the vegetables will change. We eat what the land and sea allow, following a rhythm tied to light and weather.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Meals here follow the <strong>rhythm of work</strong>. A quick cone of fried fish at midday to keep moving, and a long, slow dinner as the sun dips behind the village—a time to reclaim the day from the crowds. To eat well here is to be receptive to these rhythms, to stop looking for variety and start looking for place.

                                    "In many places, a long menu is a sign of abundance. In Riomaggiore, it is often a sign of frozen storage. Look for the places that offer only four or five starters and mains. It means the chef was at the harbor this morning, and the 'orto' yesterday. Variety is the enemy of freshness in a village this small."
