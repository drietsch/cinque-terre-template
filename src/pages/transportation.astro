From Pisa or Florence, you'll likely change at La Spezia Centrale for the 'Cinque Terre Express'—a short, 7-minute hop that feels like a portal. Once you step off the platform, a long pedestrian tunnel leads you into the heart of the village, a transition from the wide horizon to the narrow, colorful carruggi.",
        giuliaComment: "I always tell friends to keep their eyes on the window during the last few minutes from La Spezia. The first glimpse of the Riomaggiore harbor as you exit the tunnel is a moment you'll never forget. Don't rush through the station tunnel; it's the village's way of welcoming you slowly.",

However, the village itself is car-free. You must park in the multi-story garage at the top of the village or along the designated blue lines on the road. From there, your arrival begins with a 10-20 minute downhill walk, carrying your bags through the vertical streets.",
        giuliaComment: "Driving is for those who love the journey as much as the destination. The 'Litoranea' road is one of the most beautiful in Italy. But be warned: parking is expensive and limited. If you arrive by car, you are trading convenience for a spectacular first view from the top of the village.",

The boat docks directly at the small harbor, placing you immediately in the village's maritime center.",
        giuliaComment: "If the weather is clear and the sea is calm, take the boat at least once. It's the only way to truly understand why we built the village this way.

                            To arrive in Riomaggiore is to shed the speed of the modern world. Whether you come by rail, road, or sea, the village requires you to slow down before it reveals itself.

                                    The geography of the Cinque Terre is <strong>defiant</strong>. For centuries, these villages were accessible only by boat or by the narrow mule tracks that crisscross the hills. Today, while modern transport has bridged the gap, the physical reality remains: Riomaggiore is a vertical world of stone and salt, where movement is measured in steps rather than kilometers.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Knowing this in advance <strong>changes your arrival</strong>. It transforms a long tunnel or a steep parking lot from a frustration into a threshold. You are entering a place where the light changes dramatically as you move between the cliffs, and where the sound of the sea replaces the hum of the highway.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                    We encourage you to <strong>arrive with patience</strong>. The train may be crowded, the parking may be distant, and the boat may be at the mercy of the waves. But each of these paths offers a different perspective on the village's character. To arrive unhurried is to begin your journey already in sync with the pace of the coast.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Once you reach the station or the parking garage, <strong>the village begins</strong>. There is no 'lobby' here—only the street, the stairs, and the immediate presence of the houses. Allow yourself a moment to simply stand and breathe before you begin the final walk to your door.

                        Resist the urge to orient yourself immediately. Don't look at the map just yet. Allow the village to unfold gradually—the way the light enters the narrow streets, the sound of the sea at the harbor, the vertical rhythm of the houses.

                    <p>
                        You are here. The village is ready for you.
